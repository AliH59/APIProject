# Project - Car Price Prediction API

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the price of cars based on certain features such as engine volume, mileage, and other vehicle specifications. The model is built using **Random Forests**, and an **API** is created using **FastAPI** to interact with the model and make predictions.

## Features

- Predict car prices based on the following features:
  - Levy
  - Production Year
  - Engine Volume
  - Mileage
  - Cylinders
  - Doors
  - Airbags

 ## Running the API

After setting up the environment, run the FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
